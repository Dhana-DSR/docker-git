I would like to share our GitHub branching strategy and policies to streamline our code development and deployment process. Here's a concise overview:
 
Branching Structure
Feature Branches: For individual tasks, bug fixes, or new features.
Develop Branch: For testing combined changes from feature branches.
Release Branch: For QA deployments.
Master Branch: For production deployments.
Workflow
Feature Development: Create feature branches for tasks, commit and push changes.
Integration and Testing: PR from feature to develop, collaborate, and test.
QA Deployment: PR from develop to release, test thoroughly.
Production Deployment: PR from release to master, deploy to production.
Branch Policies
No direct pushes to master and release branches.
At least one reviewer approval is required for PRs into these branches.
 
This strategy promotes code quality, testing, and collaboration.
